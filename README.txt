This program scrapes and fetches information pertinent to my video lessons on unacademy.in .
A database is managed to compare views and keep track of the numbers. 
It was made to make life easier for me because initially i was excited about the views my lessons would get and it used to be very tiresome visiting 21 sites to keep track of the number of views in the lessons and the courses ofcourse. 
On the contrary, this script runs at an average of 40 seconds and does my job. :) 


Interesting Fact :

If you are an unacademy educator, all you need is to edit videolist.txt, delete existing database and you are set. Get hold of the numbers within a minute. :)
